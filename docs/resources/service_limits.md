  Railway service resource limits - configure CPU and memory allocation for a service instance.
  This resource allows you to set resource limits (CPU and memory) for a specific service in a specific environment.
  Resource limits help control costs and ensure services have the resources they need.
  Example Usage
  ```hcl
  resource "railwayservicelimits" "apiproduction" {
    serviceid     = railwayservice.api.id
    environmentid = railway_environment.production.id
  memory_gb = 2.0   # 2 GB of memory
    vcpus     = 1.0   # 1 vCPU
  }
  Different limits for staging
  resource "railwayservicelimits" "apistaging" {
    serviceid     = railwayservice.api.id
    environmentid = railway_environment.staging.id
  memory_gb = 0.5   # 512 MB of memory
    vcpus     = 0.5   # 0.5 vCPU
  }

# railway_service_limits (Resource)

Railway service resource limits - configure CPU and memory allocation for a service instance.

This resource allows you to set resource limits (CPU and memory) for a specific service in a specific environment.
Resource limits help control costs and ensure services have the resources they need.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "railway_service_limits" "api_production" {
  service_id     = railway_service.api.id
  environment_id = railway_environment.production.id

  memory_gb = 2.0   # 2 GB of memory
  vcpus     = 1.0   # 1 vCPU
}

# Different limits for staging
resource "railway_service_limits" "api_staging" {
  service_id     = railway_service.api.id
  environment_id = railway_environment.staging.id

  memory_gb = 0.5   # 512 MB of memory
  vcpus     = 0.5   # 0.5 vCPU
}
